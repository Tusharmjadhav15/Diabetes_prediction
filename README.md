This repository contains a simple Diabetes Prediction web application built with Streamlit. The app predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes using a trained machine learning model.

# Project Files
File/Folder   Purpose

diabetes.csv = Dataset used to train the model (Pima Indians Diabetes Database)

diabetes.pkl	=Saved trained machine learning model

myapp.py = Streamlit app script

notebook.ipynb	= Jupyter notebook for EDA and model building

photos      =	Contains screenshots of the app and its title page

# How It Works
User Input: The app takes medical input values such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

Prediction: The trained model (diabetes.pkl) predicts whether the patient is likely to have diabetes.

Output: Displays the prediction result directly in the app.
